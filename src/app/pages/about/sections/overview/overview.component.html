        The route connects the charming residential area of Pridniprovsky, locally referred to
        simply as Pridniprovsk, with the city center.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        On weekdays, 8 vehicles operate on the route, while on weekends, this number is reduced to
        4. The route is served by two trolleybus depots, with 4 vehicles from each depot on weekdays
        and 2 from each depot on weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the specifics of the route, as a portion of it lacks overhead contact wires, only a
        limited number of vehicles capable of autonomous operation over long distances can serve
        this route.
